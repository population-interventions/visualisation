This CRE aims to develop the evidence base for endgame strategies and will identify the most promising policies that could end the tobacco epidemic in Australia, and beyond. Our ambitious goal is to determine the optimal mix of strategies that will help Australia become a smoke free nation and produce a roadmap which outlines how to achieve a smoke free Australia.

This centre brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts in health policy, behavioural science, epidemiology, biostatistics, law, health economics, Indigenous health, environmental health, psychology, and mental health and substance use disorders from institutions in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and is committed to contributing to research training and development of the next generation of public health research leaders.

The Population Interventions Unit contribution to this CRE will be in two areas:

-   Causal inference analyses of existing data, especially longitudinal data. For example, repeated measures on participants in ITC studies (International Tobacco Control) to determine ‘causes’ for people to take up vaping. Methods used here will blend contemporary counterfactual approaches to epidemiology (e.g. G-computation, marginal structural models, causal mediation analysis), blended with econometrics.
-   Simulation modelling on future health gains and costs of tobacco control interventions. For example, are tobacco taxes inequality widening or narrowing between socioeconomic groups and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Aboriginal people? Methods used here will include processes to select, conceptualize and specify interventions, rapid reviews, simulation modelling (e.g. using our proportional multistate lifetable), and policy engagement.
